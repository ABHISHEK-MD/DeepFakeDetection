# RJPOLICE_HACK_494_t0b3h4ck3r5_8

## Deepfake Detection System

### Overview
This repository contains scripts for a Deepfake Detection System designed to identify manipulated or synthetic media content using advanced machine learning techniques.

### Requirements
- Python 3.10
- Face_Recognition
- Torch
- OpenCV
- Google Colab

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/RJPOLICE_HACK_494_t0b3h4ck3r5_8.git
   ```
   
2.Change to the project directory:
   ```
   cd RJPOLICE_HACK_494_t0b3h4ck3r5_8
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
### Usage
Use Google Colab to run the following scripts in the folder:
   1.PreProcessing.ipynb: Preprocess the data for training.
   2.Training_model.ipynb: Train the deepfake detection model.
   3.Predict.ipynb: Use the trained model to make predictions.

## View the results:
The system will generate output indicating the likelihood of the input video containing deepfake content.
