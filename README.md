# Deepfake Detection System

## Overview

This deepfake detection system is designed to identify manipulated or synthetic media content using advanced machine learning techniques.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Other dependencies (list any additional libraries or tools required)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/deepfake-detection.git
   
2. Change to the project directory:
   cd deepfake-detection

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
## Usage

Run the deepfake detection system:
   python detect_deepfake.py --input_path path/to/input/video.mp4
Replace path/to/input/video.mp4 with the path to the video you want to analyze.

## View the results:

The system will generate output indicating the likelihood of the input video containing deepfake content.
