## Deepfake Image Detection

### Overview
This project demonstrates a web application for image classification using a deep learning model. The model is trained to classify images as either real or manipulated (deepfake).

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Google Colab

   
### Usage
Use Google Colab to run the following scripts in the folder:<br>
   1.We have already trained the model.
   2.To predict the image we have to give the pretrained model in the source code, as the .h5        file is large and it can't be uploaded in the git.
   3.We will soon upload the usage document or video.
   
### View the results:
The system will generate output indicating the likelihood of the input image containing deepfake content.
